# the Data Tracker to:

Open actual social media sites in new tabs when you click on an app
Start tracking usage metrics when you open an app
Allow you to stop tracking by clicking the app again
Added URLs for each social media platform
Updated the UI to show "Click to Open" or "Click to Stop" on each app button
Now when you:

Click an app - it opens the actual website in a new tab and starts tracking
The tracker continues monitoring your usage while you browse
Click "Stop" when you're done to pause the tracking
All your usage data (time, data, cost) is saved and displayed in real-time
The tracking simulates:

Time spent on each platform
Estimated data usage
Approximate cost based on usage
Note: Since this is running in a browser, the data usage metrics are simulated. To get actual data usage metrics, this would need to be integrated with browser APIs or a system-level monitoring solution.
